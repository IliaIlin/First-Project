# First-Project

This project should help me as a trainee to become more familiar with the programming language **Java** and to bring me closer to working methods and tools that are used in real practice.

## How to get started
To get the project running on your own computer, follow the steps below.

1. Install an **IDE** (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) of your choice. In the following the installation of the IDE **IntelliJ** is described.
    1. Click [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/#section=windows "JetBrains") and download the Community version. Alternativly you can also click the following [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC "Download") which lets you download the .exe file directly.
    1. Execute the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation wizard.
        1. **Welcome** Just skip this window by clicking on *Next*.
        1. **Choose Install Location** Choose an installation location of your choice. You can also leave everything as it is and click on Next.
        1. **Choose Start Menu Folder** Just skip this window by clicking on *Next*.
        1. **Installation Options** Choose whether you want a shortcut for the program on your desktop or not. The linked file extensions *.java* and *.groovy* can be left checked. Click on *Next*.
        1. **Completing** If you want the program to open automatically after installation, check the box *Run IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition*. Click on *Finish* to start the installation.
1. Download this project by clicking on the green button *Code* in the upper right corner and choosing *Download ZIP*.
1. Extract the files from the compressed folder.
1. Open the folder in the downloaded IDE and run the Main under *First-Project-main/src/main/java/controller* by right clicking on it and choosing the action *Run Main.main()*.

### Alternative way
You also can simply download and execute the *.jar* file within the project via the console.

**Example**
Let's say we downloaded the *.jar* file into the default download folder. Then we would execute it the following way:

```
cd C:\Users\Sebastian\Downloads

java -jar first-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

```

That's all.
